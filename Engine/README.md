# Neo Engine

This is the engine - the part of this codebase that actually manages the ECS, rendering, messaging, imgui, and more. This should probably be a standalone project with the App projects using it as a submodule, but maybe I'll do that later. 


The Engine's basic usage can be mostly found in AppBase.
