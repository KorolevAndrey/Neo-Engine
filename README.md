# Neo-Engine

Game engine that has been iterated on over the years with some nice additions by some nice people. 

I use this engine to play with rendering techniques and some graphics infrastructure - no more no less. This engine _can_ be used to create a game -- checkout [Battle Royale with Cheese](https://github.com/jaafersheriff/BattleRoyale) to see that. But for the most part you won't find complex AI, animation, gameplay, or art in this engine. You will find a collection of fun rendering techniques.
